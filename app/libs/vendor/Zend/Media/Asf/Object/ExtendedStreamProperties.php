/**
 * The <i>Extended Stream Properties Object</i> defines additional optional
 * properties and characteristics of a digital media stream that are not
 * described in the <i>Stream Properties Object</i>.
 *
 * Typically, the basic <i>Stream Properties Object</i> is present in the
 * <i>Header Object</i>, and the <i>Extended Stream Properties Object</i> is
 * present in the <i>Header Extension Object</i>. Sometimes, however, the
 * <i>Stream Properties Object</i> for a stream may be embedded inside the
 * <i>Extended Stream Properties Object</i> for that stream. This approach
 * facilitates the creation of backward-compatible content.
 *
 * This object has an optional provision to include application-specific or
 * implementation-specific data attached to the payloads of each digital media
 * sample stored within a <i>Data Packet</i>. This data can be looked at as
 * digital media sample properties and is stored in the <i>Replicated Data</i>
 * field of a payload header. The <i>Payload Extension Systems</i> fields of the
 * <i>Extended Stream Properties Object</i> describes what this data is and is
 * necessary for that data to be parsed, if present.
