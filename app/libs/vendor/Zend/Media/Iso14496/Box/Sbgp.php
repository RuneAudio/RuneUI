/**
 * The <i>Sample To Group Box</i> table can be used to find the group that a
 * sample belongs to and the associated description of that sample group. The
 * table is compactly coded with each entry giving the index of the first sample
 * of a run of samples with the same sample group descriptor. The sample group
 * description ID is an index that refers to a
 * {@link Zend_Media_Iso14496_Box_Sgpd Sample Group Description Box}, which
 * contains entries describing the characteristics of each sample group.
 *
 * There may be multiple instances of this box if there is more than one sample
 * grouping for the samples in a track. Each instance of the Sample To Group Box
 * has a type code that distinguishes different sample groupings. Within a
 * track, there shall be at most one instance of this box with a particular
 * grouping type. The associated Sample Group Description shall indicate the
 * same value for the grouping type.
