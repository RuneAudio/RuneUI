/**
 * The <i>Track Box</i> is a container box for a single track of a presentation.
 * A presentation consists of one or more tracks. Each track is independent of
 * the other tracks in the presentation and carries its own temporal and spatial
 * information. Each track will contain its associated
 * {@link Zend_Media_Iso14496_Box_Mdia Media Box}.
 *
 * Tracks are used for two purposes:
 *  (a) to contain media data (media tracks) and
 *  (b) to contain packetization information for streaming protocols
 *      (hint tracks).
 * There shall be at least one media track within an ISO file, and all the media
 * tracks that contributed to the hint tracks shall remain in the file, even if
 * the media data within them is not referenced by the hint tracks; after
 * deleting all hint tracks, the entire un-hinted presentation shall remain.
