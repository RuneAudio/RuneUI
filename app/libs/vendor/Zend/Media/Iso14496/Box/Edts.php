 * The <i>Edit Box</i> maps the presentation time-line to the media time-line as
 * it is stored in the file. The Edit Box is a container for the edit lists.
 *
 * The Edit Box is optional. In the absence of this box, there is an implicit
 * one-to-one mapping of these time-lines, and the presentation of a track
 * starts at the beginning of the presentation. An empty edit is used to offset
 * the start time of a track.
