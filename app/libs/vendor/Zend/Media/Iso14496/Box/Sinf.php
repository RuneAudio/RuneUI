/**
 * The <i>Protection Scheme Information Box</i> contains all the information
 * required both to understand the encryption transform applied and its
 * parameters, and also to find other information such as the kind and location
 * of the key management system. It also documents the original (unencrypted)
 * format of the media. The Protection Scheme Info Box is a container Box. It is
 * mandatory in a sample entry that uses a code indicating a protected stream.
 *
 * When used in a protected sample entry, this box must contain the original
 * format box to document the original format. At least one of the following
 * signaling methods must be used to identify the protection applied:
 *
 *  a) MPEG-4 systems with IPMP: no other boxes, when IPMP descriptors in MPEG-4
 *     systems streams are used;
 *  b) Standalone IPMP: an {@link Zend_Media_Iso14496_Box_Imif IPMP Info Box},
 *     when IPMP descriptors outside MPEG-4 systems are used;
 *  c) Scheme signaling: a {@link Zend_Media_Iso14496_Box_Schm Scheme Type Box}
 *     and {@link Zend_Media_Iso14496_Box_Schi Scheme Information Box}, when
 *     these are used (either both must occur, or neither).
