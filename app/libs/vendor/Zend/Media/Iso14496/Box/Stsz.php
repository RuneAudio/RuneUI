/**
 * The <i>Sample Size Box</i> contains the sample count and a table giving the
 * size in bytes of each sample. This allows the media data itself to be
 * unframed. The total number of samples in the media is always indicated in the
 * sample count.
 *
 * There are two variants of the sample size box. The first variant has a fixed
 * size 32-bit field for representing the sample sizes; it permits defining a
 * constant size for all samples in a track. The second variant permits smaller
 * size fields, to save space when the sizes are varying but small. One of these
 * boxes must be present; the first version is preferred for maximum
 * compatibility.
