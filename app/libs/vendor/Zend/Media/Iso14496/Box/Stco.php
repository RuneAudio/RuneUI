/**
 * The <i>Chunk Offset Box</i> table gives the index of each chunk into the
 * containing file. There are two variants, permitting the use of 32-bit or
 * 64-bit offsets. The latter is useful when managing very large presentations.
 * At most one of these variants will occur in any single instance of a sample
 * table.
 *
 * Offsets are file offsets, not the offset into any box within the file (e.g.
 * {@link Zend_Media_Iso14496_Box_Mdat Media Data Box}). This permits referring
 * to media data in files without any box structure. It does also mean that care
 * must be taken when constructing a self-contained ISO file with its metadata
 * ({@link Zend_Media_Iso14496_Box_Moov Movie Box}) at the front, as the size of
 * the {@link Zend_Media_Iso14496_Box_Moov Movie Box} will affect the chunk
 * offsets to the media data.
 *
 * This box variant contains 32-bit offsets.
