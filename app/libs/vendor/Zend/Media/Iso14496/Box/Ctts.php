/**
 * The <i>Composition Time to Sample Box</i> provides the offset between
 * decoding time and composition time. Since decoding time must be less than the
 * composition time, the offsets are expressed as unsigned numbers such that
 * CT(n) = DT(n) + CTTS(n) where CTTS(n) is the (uncompressed) table entry for
 * sample n.
 *
 * The composition time to sample table is optional and must only be present if
 * DT and CT differ for any samples. Hint tracks do not use this box.
