/**
 * The <i>Track Reference Box</i> provides a reference from the containing track
 * to another track in the presentation. These references are typed. A
 * {@link Zend_Media_Iso14496_Box_Hint hint} reference links from the containing
 * hint track to the media data that it hints. A content description reference
 * {@link Zend_Media_Iso14496_Box_Cdsc cdsc} links a descriptive or metadata
 * track to the content which it describes.
 *
 * Exactly one Track Reference Box can be contained within the
 * {@link Zend_Media_Iso14496_Box_Trak Track Box}.
 *
 * If this box is not present, the track is not referencing any other track in
 * any way. The reference array is sized to fill the reference type box.
