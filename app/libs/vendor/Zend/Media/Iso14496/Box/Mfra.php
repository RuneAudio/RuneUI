/**
 * The <i>Movie Fragment Random Access Box</i> provides a table which may assist
 * readers in finding random access points in a file using movie fragments. It
 * contains a track fragment random access box for each track for which
 * information is provided (which may not be all tracks). It is usually placed
 * at or near the end of the file; the last box within the Movie Fragment Random
 * Access Box provides a copy of the length field from the Movie Fragment Random
 * Access Box. Readers may attempt to find this box by examining the last 32
 * bits of the file, or scanning backwards from the end of the file for a Movie
 * Fragment Random Access Offset Box and using the size information in it, to
 * see if that locates the beginning of a Movie Fragment Random Access Box.
 *
 * This box provides only a hint as to where random access points are; the movie
 * fragments themselves are definitive. It is recommended that readers take care
 * in both locating and using this box as modifications to the file after it was
 * created may render either the pointers, or the declaration of random access
 * points, incorrect.
