/**
 * Samples within the media data are grouped into chunks. Chunks can be of
 * different sizes, and the samples within a chunk can have different sizes.
 * The <i>Sample To Chunk Box</i> table can be used to find the chunk that
 * contains a sample, its position, and the associated sample description.
 *
 * The table is compactly coded. Each entry gives the index of the first chunk
 * of a run of chunks with the same characteristics. By subtracting one entry
 * here from the previous one, you can compute how many chunks are in this run.
 * You can convert this to a sample count by multiplying by the appropriate
 * samplesPerChunk.
