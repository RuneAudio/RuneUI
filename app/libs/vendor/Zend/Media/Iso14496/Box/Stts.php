/**
 * The <i>Decoding Time to Sample Box</i> contains a compact version of a table
 * that allows indexing from decoding time to sample number. Other tables give
 * sample sizes and pointers, from the sample number. Each entry in the table
 * gives the number of consecutive samples with the same time delta, and the
 * delta of those samples. By adding the deltas a complete time-to-sample map
 * may be built.
 *
 * The Decoding Time to Sample Box contains decode time delta's: DT(n+1) = DT(n)
 * + STTS(n) where STTS(n) is the (uncompressed) table entry for sample n.
 *
 * The sample entries are ordered by decoding time stamps; therefore the deltas
 * are all non-negative.
 *
 * The DT axis has a zero origin; DT(i) = SUM(for j=0 to i-1 of delta(j)), and
 * the sum of all deltas gives the length of the media in the track (not mapped
 * to the overall timescale, and not considering any edit list).
 *
 * The {@link Zend_Media_Iso14496_Box_Elst Edit List Box} provides the initial
 * CT value if it is non-empty (non-zero).
